# Rootlinked
A Minecraft datapack where you can only walk on logs.
This was inspired by a forum post where someone gave about fifty ideas for survival challenges: This was one of them.

## How it works
This datapack creates two teams:
- The Wood team: Players in this team can only walk on logs and non-solid blocks such as torches (The list of walkable blocks is set in the `#rootlinked:walkable` tag). 
Trying to walk on pretty much anything else instantly kills the player.
- The Grace team: Players are set to this team at the start or when they die. They can walk everywhere, but get transferred to the Wood team the moment they step on a log.

Players who are not part of those teams are not affected by the datapack.
